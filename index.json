In animals, overnight fasting sensitizes the mesolimbic-dopaminergic activity governing avoidance, reward, and fear-extinction learning. Despite evidence that overnight fasting may also affect reward and fear learning in humans, effects on human avoidance learning have not been studied yet. Here, we examined the effects of 16h-overnight fasting on instrumental avoidance and relief from threat omission. To this end, 50 healthy women were randomly assigned to a fasting (N=25) or a re-feeding group (N=25) and performed an Avoidance-Relief Task. We found that fasting decreases unnecessary avoidance during signaled safety; this effect was mediated via a reduction in relief pleasantness during signaled absence of threat. A fasting-induced reduction in relief was also found during fear extinction learning. We conclude that fasting optimizes avoidance and safety learning. Future studies should test whether these effects also hold for anxious individuals.","tags":["fasting","food deprivation","avoidance","extinction","reward","relief","anxiety"],"title":"The drive for thinness: Towards a mechanistic understanding of avoidance behaviors in a non-clinical population","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Iris Lange","Silvia Papalini","Bram Vervliet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"59a5edc7dc521144d17e9f4dfc80e49e","permalink":"https://silviapapalini.github.io/publication/criteria/","publishdate":"2021-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/criteria/","section":"publication","summary":"Experimental Psychopathology (EPP) and the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) are research approaches that have developed in parallel, providing inter-related yet different scientific frameworks to investigate psychopathology at the intersection of fundamental and applied research.

This fear motivates behaviors aimed at avoiding weight gain, such as restricting food intake. Of note, avoidance in AN is not confined to food-related items but extends to intense emotional states. Despite the presence of several forms of excessive avoidance in AN, little is known about the mechanisms underpinning avoidance behavior in AN. In the present exploratory study, we investigated whether university students with an elevated desire to avoid weight gain (as measured through self-reported Drive for Thinness, DT) show deficits in generic avoidance learning. Two-hundred and seventy-five female students filled in the Eating Disorder Inventory-II (EDI-II) and performed a food-unrelated avoidance task. Generalized and linear mixed models (GLMM) revealed that students scoring higher on the DT scale of the EDI-II showed more ineffective avoidance, suggesting a tendency for excessive avoidance in at-risk individuals for AN. Similar results might extend to other eating disorders.","tags":[],"title":"The drive for thinness: Towards a mechanistic understanding of avoidance behaviors in a non-clinical population","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Berthold-Losleben M.","Silvia Papalini","Habel U.","Losleben K.","Schneider F.","Amunts K.","Kohn N."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619395200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619395200,"objectID":"27f50dfdcf93249d50131bdbba434cef","permalink":"https://silviapapalini.github.io/publication/musical/","publishdate":"2021-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/musical/","section":"publication","summary":" Background In everyday life, negative emotions can be implicitly regulated by positive stimuli, without any conscious cognitive engagement; however, the effects of such implicit regulation on mood and related neuro-mechanisms, remain poorly investigated in literature.

Probiotics remediate somatic and behavioral stress responses, hypothetically by acting on the gut microbiota. Here, in exploratory analyses, we assessed gut microbial alterations after 28-days supplementation of multi-strain probiotics (EcologicBarrier consisting of Lactobacilli, Lactococci, and Bifidobacteria in healthy, female subjects (probiotics group n = 27, placebo group n = 29). In an identical pre-session and post-session, subjects performed a working memory task before and after an acute stress intervention. Global gut microbial beta diversity changed over time, but we were not able to detect differences between intervention groups. At the taxonomic level, Time by Intervention interactions were not significant after multiple comparison correction; the relative abundance of eight genera in the probiotics group was higher (uncorrected) relative to the placebo group: Butyricimonas, Parabacteroides, Alistipes, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Family_XIII_AD3011_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-003, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010. In a second analysis step, association analyses were done only within this selection of microbial genera, revealing the probiotics-induced change in genus Ruminococcaceae_UCG-003 was significantly associated with probiotics’ effect on stress-induced working memory changes (rspearman(27) = 0.565; pFDR = 0.014) in the probiotics group only and independent of potential confounders (i.e., age, BMI, and baseline dietary fiber intake). That is subjects with a higher increase in Ruminococcaceae_UCG-003 abundance after probiotics were also more protected from negative effects of stress on working memory after probiotic supplementation. The bacterial taxa showing an increase in relative abundance in the probiotics group are plant fiber degrading bacteria and produce short-chain fatty acids that are known for their beneficial effect on gut and brain health, e.g., maintaining intestinal-barrier and blood–brain-barrier integrity. This study shows that gut microbial alterations, modulated through probiotics use, are related to improved cognitive performance in acute stress circumstances.","tags":[],"title":"Probiotics-induced changes in gut microbial composition and its effects on cognitive performance after stress: exploratory analyses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silvia Papalini","Tom Beckers","Bram Vervliet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587427200,"objectID":"e5659a8b41fb3224271b59ba8fbda781","permalink":"https://silviapapalini.github.io/publication/dopamine/","publishdate":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dopamine/","section":"publication","summary":"Dopamine, one of the main neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain, has been implicated in the coding of prediction errors that govern reward learning as well as fear extinction learning. Psychotherapy too can be viewed as a form of error-based learning, because it challenges erroneous beliefs and behavioral patterns in order to induce long-term changes in emotions, cognitions, and behaviors. Exposure therapy, for example, relies in part on fear extinction principles to violate erroneous expectancies of danger and induce novel safety learning that inhibits and therefore reduces fear in the long term. As most forms of psychotherapy, however, exposure therapy suffers from non-response, dropout, and relapse. This narrative review focuses on the role of midbrain and prefrontal dopamine in novel safety learning and investigates possible pathways through which dopamine-based interventions could be used as an adjunct to improve both the response and the long-term effects of the therapy. Convincing evidence exists for an involvement of the midbrain dopamine system in the acquisition of new, safe memories. Additionally, prefrontal dopamine is emerging as a key ingredient for the consolidation of fear extinction. We propose that applying a dopamine prediction error perspective to psychotherapy can inspire both pharmacological and non-pharmacological studies aimed at discovering innovative ways to enhance the acquisition of safety memories. Additionally, we call for further empirical investigations on dopamine-oriented drugs that might be able to maximize consolidation of successful fear extinction and its long-term retention after therapy, and we propose to also include investigations on non-pharmacological interventions with putative prefrontal dopaminergic effects, like working memory training.","tags":["Neuroscience","Physiology"],"title":"Dopamine: From prediction error to psychotherapy","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Differently from healthy individuals, in AN hunger seems to be perceived as a threat rather than a motivational drive for food intake. Hence, the anorexic subject avoids food and increases avoidance behaviors (e.g. exercising) to prevent /control the consequences of hunger (i.e. weight gain). Unlike excessive avoidance that characterizes other anxiety-related psychopathologies, excessive avoidance in AN has been often conceptualized as a personality trait (harm avoidance). Yet, a deeper mechanistic understanding of avoidance behaviors in AN is missing in literature.

Exposure treatment with response prevention (ET+RP) is aimed at exposing patients to their obsessive thoughts and perceived threats, while preventing engagement in compulsive avoidant responses. This induces extinction of threat perception and fearful arousal and hence reduces the motivation to avoid. While successful in many patients, however, as much as 40% dropout during treatment or display persistent avoidance after ET+RP. There is a clear need for treatment improvement for these often highly disabled patients.\nImproving ET+RP outcomes requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive excessive and persistent avoidance in OCD patients. Psychological theories ascribe an important role to the relief that follows avoidance when the anticipated threat is successfully averted. This positive feeling arguably functions as a reward to reinforce the foregoing avoidance actions. Indeed, fMRI studies have found that the neurocircuitry of relief overlaps with that of reward, including the ventral tegmental area [VTA], ventral striatum [Nuclei Accumbens] and orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]. This project tests the hypothesis that excessive-persistent avoidance is linked to exaggerated activation of the relief circuitry in OCD participants. For this purpose, we are acquiring functional (and at rest) brain images of OCD and healthy participants in an MRI scanner while they perform a computer task that is designed to model avoidance learning and relief.\n","date":1540252800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540252800,"objectID":"b5ff5a035f4e078b3c8b69a057b51928","permalink":"https://silviapapalini.github.io/project/ocd/","publishdate":"2018-10-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ocd/","section":"project","summary":"We are examining how the brain of individuals with an obsessive-compulsive disorder processes relief during avoidance learning.","tags":null,"title":"The neurocircuitry of relief in pathological avoidance","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In clinical practice, there is a high need to improve the efficacy and long-term outcome of treatments for excessive avoidance and pathological anxiety.

Consequently, this project investigates the effects of overnight fasting (16h) on two different dopamine-based types of learning, both highly relevant in anxiety-related disorders: instrumental avoidance learning and fear extinction learning. Given that fasting enhances the representational value of a reward (i.e. food and money), we are additionally examining if the effects of fasting transfer to other types of reinforcers, as so, to relief from threat omission.
