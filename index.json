The empirical research is instead providing clear data that fasting should be used carefully since this practice triggers beneficial as well as harmful chemical events in the body. One of the consequences of these events is that fasting can induce significant changes in the mesolimbic dopaminergic brain, the system that tunes our learning signals. In this talk, I will present the results of our last experiments where I investigated the effects of overnight fasting (16h) on two different dopamine-based types of learning: instrumental avoidance learning and fear extinction learning, with a strong emphasis on fasting effects on relief (reward). Specifically, since exaggerating relief from threat omission might over-reinforce instrumental avoidance in the anxious clinical population, these experiments provide a window on how fasting increases relief, and, consequently, avoidance behaviors. The results that I will present can help to enhance awareness about the effects of fasting on our psychophysiological functions and can be of great importance for the clinical field.

Here, we examined the effects of 16h-overnight fasting on instrumental avoidance and relief from threat omission. To this end, 50 healthy women were randomly assigned to a fasting (N=25) or a re-feeding group (N=25) and performed an Avoidance-Relief Task. We found that fasting decreases unnecessary avoidance during signaled safety; this effect was mediated via a reduction in relief pleasantness during signaled absence of threat. A fasting-induced reduction in relief was also found during fear extinction learning. We conclude that fasting optimizes avoidance and safety learning.

In an identical pre-session and post-session, subjects performed a working memory task before and after an acute stress intervention. Global gut microbial beta diversity changed over time, but we were not able to detect differences between intervention groups.

Forty-two participants performed an avoidance task within a typical fear renewal procedure.

During subsequent avoidance learning, clicking a button canceled the delivery of the US during one but not the other CS+. Fear-related levels were then reduced by removing the US and the button in a new context (fear extinction with response prevention [Ext-RP]). Next, persistence of avoidance was tested in the extinction context B (group ABB) or the original conditioning context A (group ABA). We also tested whether ratings of relief pleasantness (based on both the CS- and the avoided CS+) during avoidance and Ext-RP predicted individual levels of persistent avoidance. Results showed that persistent avoidance was higher in conditioning context A than in extinction context B, and was predicted by higher relief pleasantness during avoidance conditioning. We conclude that persistent avoidance poses a threat to the long-term success of Ext-RP, and we propose that interventions aimed at mitigating the influence of context and relief levels might prove beneficial in this regard.","tags":["Anxiety disorders","Avoidance behaviors","Conditioning","Fear extinction","Relief","Reward"],"title":"The role of context in persistent avoidance and the predictive value of relief","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silvia Papalini","Tom Beckers","Bram Vervliet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587427200,"objectID":"e5659a8b41fb3224271b59ba8fbda781","permalink":"https://silviapapalini.github.io/publication/dopamine/","publishdate":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dopamine/","section":"publication","summary":"Dopamine, one of the main neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain, has been implicated in the coding of prediction errors that govern reward learning as well as fear extinction learning. Psychotherapy too can be viewed as a form of error-based learning, because it challenges erroneous beliefs and behavioral patterns in order to induce long-term changes in emotions, cognitions, and behaviors. Exposure therapy, for example, relies in part on fear extinction principles to violate erroneous expectancies of danger and induce novel safety learning that inhibits and therefore reduces fear in the long term. As most forms of psychotherapy, however, exposure therapy suffers from non-response, dropout, and relapse. This narrative review focuses on the role of midbrain and prefrontal dopamine in novel safety learning and investigates possible pathways through which dopamine-based interventions could be used as an adjunct to improve both the response and the long-term effects of the therapy. Convincing evidence exists for an involvement of the midbrain dopamine system in the acquisition of new, safe memories. Additionally, prefrontal dopamine is emerging as a key ingredient for the consolidation of fear extinction. We propose that applying a dopamine prediction error perspective to psychotherapy can inspire both pharmacological and non-pharmacological studies aimed at discovering innovative ways to enhance the acquisition of safety memories. Additionally, we call for further empirical investigations on dopamine-oriented drugs that might be able to maximize consolidation of successful fear extinction and its long-term retention after therapy, and we propose to also include investigations on non-pharmacological interventions with putative prefrontal dopaminergic effects, like working memory training.","tags":["Neuroscience","Physiology"],"title":"Dopamine: From prediction error to psychotherapy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stijn Michielse","Iris Lange","Jindra Bakker","Liesbet Goossens","Silvia Papalini","Simone Verhagen","Marieke Wichers","Ritsaert Lieverse","Therese van Amelsvoort","Koen Schruers","Jim van Os","Graham Murray","Machteld Marcelis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"f286d81799d8167b09080e69ebf29f7c","permalink":"https://silviapapalini.github.io/publication/expression/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/expression/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous research in patients with psychotic disorder has shown widespread abnormalities in brain activation during reward anticipation. Research at the level of subclinical psychotic experiences in individuals unexposed to antipsychotic medication is limited with inconclusive results. Therefore, brain activation during reward anticipation was examined in a larger sample of individuals with subclinical psychotic experiences (PE). Participants in the PE-group were included based on CAPE scores. A sample of emerging adults aged 16–26 years (n = 47) with PE and healthy controls (HC) (n = 40) underwent fMRI scanning. The Monetary Incentive Delay task was conducted with cues related to win, loss or neutral conditions. fMRI nonparametric tests were used to examine the reward versus neutral cue contrast. A significant main effect of the large win (€3.00)  neutral contrast was found in both groups showing activation in many brain areas, including classic reward regions. Whole brain analysis on the group comparison regarding the large win  neutral contrast showed significantly decreased activation in the right insula, putamen and supramarginal gyrus in the PE-group compared to controls. There was no group difference in the hypothesized reward-related region. Decreased activation in the right insula, putamen and supramarginal gyrus during reward anticipation in individuals with PE may be consistent with altered processing of sensory information, related to decreased emotional valuing and motivational tendencies and/or altered motor-cognitive processes. The absence of group differences in striatal activation suggests that activation here is intact in the earliest stages of psychosis and may exhibit progressive deterioration in as the disease develops.","tags":["dopamine","cues","early intervention (education)","educational status","neostriatum","nucleus accumbens","prefrontal cortex","psychotic disorders","reaction time","ventral tegmental area","brain","reward","gender","avoidance behavior","functional magnetic resonance imaging","brain activity","incentives","young adult","money","positive reinforcement","ventral striatum"],"title":"Reward Anticipation in Early Expression of Psychotic Disorder: A Functional MRI Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Without stress induction, probiotics did not affect brain, behavioral, or related self-report measures.

This induces extinction of threat perception and fearful arousal and hence reduces the motivation to avoid. While successful in many patients, however, as much as 40% dropout during treatment or display persistent avoidance after ET+RP. There is a clear need for treatment improvement for these often highly disabled patients.\nImproving ET+RP outcomes requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive excessive and persistent avoidance in OCD patients.

To date, fasting for esthetical reasons or for unhealthy habits are the common behaviors that lead to low blood glucose levels; however, their effects on brain functioning, such as memory processes, attention levels, and self-control are still poorly investigated. The present work wants to summarize some of the most recent evidences on prolonged fasting effects on brain functioning and attempts to integrate these evidences in a recent model of self-regulation. Additionally, the consequences of low blood glucose levels on neuronal activities (fMRI) are described and discussed from the practical and clinical point of view. Overall, prolonged fasting and subsequent low blood glucose levels seem to decrease self-regulation abilities and negatively affect the attentional system. These results suggest that glucose levels need to be taken in account in fMRI protocols and monitored in circumstances where brain functioning is already compromised, such as in dementia and psychiatric conditions.","tags":[],"title":"Influences of Prolonged Fasting on Behavioral and Brain Patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"What is mindfulness eating? “Mindful eating involves paying full attention to the experience of eating and drinking, both inside and outside the body…We notice how eating affects our mood and how our emotions like anxiety influence our eating. Gradually we regain the sense of ease and freedom with eating that we had in childhood. It is our natural birthright.” (cit. by Jan Chozen Bays and Char Wilkins).\nI was introduced to Mindfulness Eating by Caroline Baerten, one of the most inspiring persons I ever met in my life. She followed me during my course in Mindful Based Stress Reduction (MBRS) in Brussel, and, as simple it might sound, I found myself fully connected to the ZEN-based philosophy of this practice. I then felt that a formative mindful path that was closer to my research interest, passions, and values, was really needed. Hence, I flew to Norway where I had the immense pleasure to attend the Mindful Eating-Conscious Living training with Jan Chozen Bays and Char Wilkins (https://me-cl.com/our-story/), the greatest experience of my life.\nMy wish for the future? To reach excellent research output that can be used to improve the results of this valuable practice.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"c1a344009868804812a2c0f6deb8caf9","permalink":"https://silviapapalini.github.io/mindfulness/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mindfulness/","section":"","summary":"An example of using the in-built project page.","tags":null,"title":"Mindfulness Eating","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://silviapapalini.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My accademic path   I hold a Master’s degree in Experimental Psychology and obtained my first Ph.D. in Psychological Sciences at the University of Florence (UniFi), Italy, conducting basic research on reward-related brain processes in humans.

In 2016, I became a member of the ‘Food and Cognition group’ at the Donders Institute (The Netherlands) where I investigated the effects of a probiotic diet on neuro-cognition and stress, with a focus on cognitive control mechanisms. In 2018, I started a second Ph.D. at KULeuven with the aim to translate knowledge from fundamental research to the clinical field.\nMy research The final aim of my research is to help people that struggle with excessive anxiety and emotional (non)eating. I am fascinated by the bidirectional relationship between food and learning. Currently, I am investigating the effects of overnight fasting and the role of dopamine-mediated mechanisms (i.e., relief) on conditioning, error-based learning, and instrumental avoidance. I am conducting research in healthy individuals as well as in individuals with pathological control and excessive avoidance behaviors (i.e., anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder). In my research, I like to apply an interdisciplinary approach, integrating behavioral research, nutritional science, and neuroimaging (3TfMRI). To transfer my scientific knowledge to the applied field I have participated in the Mindful Eating professional training (ME-CL1) and became a Mindful Eating teacher in training.\nMy future aspirations as researcher Currently, I am a European Research Council (ERC) starting grant aspirant/applicant.

Fortunately, I had the greatest luck to grow up in a beautiful and peaceful place (Castell’Azzara) in the middle of Italy, and to stay close to the work of one of my best teachers in life: my brother, Leo.\nLeo coultivates olive trees and produces fresh olive oil every year. His love and respect for Nature are so deeply honest that it is difficult to do not get inspired by the way he does his job (I would better call it passion or value). Leo is interested in learning how to help grow and reproduce the olive trees, follows courses to learn about the best way of pruning in its geographic region, checks its olive trees every day to be sure they get enough water and nutrients that can protect them from diseases when seasons change or are particularly harsh. In few words Leo builded up his own LAB. I followed his teaching, picking ‘my own’ trees of interest (people), but maintaining that way of connection with/ and caring for nature.\nThe fresh olive oil comes from his hard work of harvest in November (about 300 plants) when me and the rest of the family are trying to help him with some manual work. Yes, I said manual. Why? Leo wants to avoid damaging the trees during their production with aggressive machines that could break their branches. The olives are picked carefully, and brough as soon as possible to the local oil mill to avoid the formation of molds and bacteria. Once the olive oil is ready, he checks its color, odor, and density. He tastes the olive oil with all its senses, in silent connection with his body. My brother is a great mindfuleating teacher on his own LAB and he doesn’t know (and it dosen’t have to). During my mindful eating training in Norway, I could see a strong parallel between my brother’s way to relate to food and eating and the teaching of the masters. It felt very familiar.\nNature, the eternal mother, is a great place to find answers if you are connected it to it; that’s what Leo would tell me when difficult questions arise in life, either scientific or personal.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"16e559fce92ed094739f2a51f4677b6b","permalink":"https://silviapapalini.github.io/roots-in-nature/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/roots-in-nature/","section":"","summary":"In many ways, my approach to research and interest in mindful eating are connected to Nature.\nNature might seem something far away from a scientist who spends most of her time in the LAB, but that is only partially true.","tags":null,"title":"Roots in Nature","type":"page"},{"authors":["Silvia Papalini","Iris Lange","Jindra Bakker","Stijn Michielse","Machteld Marcelis","Marieke Wichers","Bram Vervliet","Jim van Os","Therese Van Amelsvoort","Liesbet Goossens","Koen Schruers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c01551e8cf9000f327d5b914fecbaf5e","permalink":"https://silviapapalini.github.io/publication/exposure/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/exposure/","section":"publication","summary":" Background: Exposure is the gold standard treatment for phobic anxiety and is thought to represent the clinical application of extinction learning. Reward sensitivity might however also represent a predictive factor for exposure therapy outcome, as this therapy promotes positive experiences and involves positive comments by the therapist. We hypothesized that high reward sensitivity, as expressed by elevated reward expectancy and reward value, can be associated with better outcome to exposure therapy specifically.\nMethods: Forty-four participants with a specific phobia for spiders were included in the current study. Participants were randomly assigned to exposure therapy (n = 25) or progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) (n = 19). Treatment outcome was defined as pre- versus post-therapy phobia symptoms. Before treatment, functional brain responses and behavioral responses (i.e. reaction time and accuracy) during reward anticipation and consumption were assessed with the Monetary Incentive Delay task (MID). Behavioral and neural responses in regions of interest (i.e. nucleus accumbens, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the ventral tegmental area) as well as across the whole-brain were subsequently regressed on treatment outcomes.\nResults: Exposure therapy was more effective in reducing phobia symptoms than PMR. Longer reaction times to reward cues and lower activation in the left posterior cingulate cortex during reward consumption were selectively associated with symptoms reductions following exposure therapy but not following PMR. Only within the exposure therapy group, greater symptom reduction was related to increased activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during reward anticipation, and decreased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex during reward consumption.\nConclusion: Results indicate that individual differences in reward sensitivity can specifically predict exposure therapy outcome. Although activation in regions of interest were not related to therapy outcome, regions involved in attentional processing of reward cues were predictive of phobic symptom change following exposure therapy but not PMR.
