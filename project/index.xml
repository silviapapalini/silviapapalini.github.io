Differently from healthy individuals, in AN hunger seems to be perceived as a threat rather than a motivational drive for food intake. Hence, the anorexic subject avoids food and increases avoidance behaviors (e.g. exercising) to prevent /control the consequences of hunger (i.e. weight gain). Unlike excessive avoidance that characterizes other anxiety-related psychopathologies, excessive avoidance in AN has been often conceptualized as a personality trait (harm avoidance). Yet, a deeper mechanistic understanding of avoidance behaviors in AN is missing in literature. In this project, we are employing an avoidance-relief task (ART) to investigate the presence of excessive avoidance (and the possible over-reinforcing effects of relief on its course) in individuals with a diagnosis of AN.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The neurocircuitry of relief in pathological avoidance</title><link>https://silviapapalini.github.io/project/ocd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviapapalini.github.io/project/ocd/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many compulsions displayed by obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients serve to protect against perceived threat and can therefore be conceptualized as ‘avoidance responses’. Exposure treatment with response prevention (ET+RP) is aimed at exposing patients to their obsessive thoughts and perceived threats, while preventing engagement in compulsive avoidant responses. This induces extinction of threat perception and fearful arousal and hence reduces the motivation to avoid. While successful in many patients, however, as much as 40% dropout during treatment or display persistent avoidance after ET+RP. There is a clear need for treatment improvement for these often highly disabled patients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Improving ET+RP outcomes requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive excessive and persistent avoidance in OCD patients. Psychological theories ascribe an important role to the relief that follows avoidance when the anticipated threat is successfully averted. This positive feeling arguably functions as a reward to reinforce the foregoing avoidance actions. Indeed, fMRI studies have found that the neurocircuitry of relief overlaps with that of reward, including the ventral tegmental area [VTA], ventral striatum [Nuclei Accumbens] and orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]. This project tests the hypothesis that excessive-persistent avoidance is linked to exaggerated activation of the relief circuitry in OCD participants. For this purpose, we are acquiring functional (and at rest) brain images of OCD and healthy participants in an MRI scanner while they perform a computer task that is designed to model avoidance learning and relief.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The power of hunger</title><link>https://silviapapalini.github.io/project/fasting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://silviapapalini.github.io/project/fasting/</guid><description>&lt;p>In clinical practice, there is a high need to improve the efficacy and long-term outcome of treatments for excessive avoidance and pathological anxiety. This project pinpoints fasting as an emerging, low cost, and safe adjunct to psychotherapy, which effects on behavior and cognition remain, however, to be clarified.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Emerging evidence indicates that fasting triggers a cascade of chemical events able to sensitize the mesolimbic dopaminergic brain, the system which tunes learning signals. Consequently, this project investigates the effects of overnight fasting (16h) on two different dopamine-based types of learning, both highly relevant in anxiety-related disorders: instrumental avoidance learning and fear extinction learning. Given that fasting enhances the representational value of a reward (i.e. food and money), we are additionally examining if the effects of fasting transfer to other types of reinforcers, as so, to relief from threat omission. Specifically, since exaggerating relief from threat omission might over-reinforce instrumental avoidance in the clinical population, in this study we examine is fasting increases relief, and, consequently, avoidance behaviors.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
