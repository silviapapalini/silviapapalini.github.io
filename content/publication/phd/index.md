abstract: Avoidance is a class of behaviors that are aimed at preventing or terminating aversive events, in order to achieve safety. Avoidance behaviors are important in threatening situations, but they lose their adaptive functionality when they extend to safe situations without threat. These unnecessary avoidance behaviors can hinder other valued activities and contribute to the development and maintenance of mental disorders, most prominently anxiety disorders. To understand how avoidance behaviors are biologically supported, the first part of Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 reviews animal and human conditioning studies that point to a neural dopaminergic basis of safety learning in fear extinction and avoidance learning. The second part of Chapter 1 develops a mechanistic model to explain the learning and maintenance of avoidance. This model goes beyond the typical idea that avoidance is motivated by fear of an impending aversive event and focuses on the involvement of reward-related processes. The remaining chapters of the thesis are aimed at testing hypotheses from this model. Chapter 3 examines whether the pleasantness of subjective relief experienced during successful avoidance of a threat increases the future probability of the avoidance action during safe situations (in healthy individuals). Chapter 4 investigates if fasting, a manipulation-diet with strong effects on the mesolimbic dopamine system, affects avoidance and relief in healthy individuals. Building on these tests of acute fasting, Chapter 5 investigates whether personality traits that confer a vulnerability to chronic fasting (as in some eating disorders), similarly influence avoidance and relief. Finally, Chapter 6 offers a critical discussion of the evidence collected from this Ph.D. thesis. As we will see, avoidance learning is influenced not only by fear, but also by several other factors. These include context change, reward-related processes such as relief, and homeostatic states like hunger.
