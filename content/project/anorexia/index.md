Individuals suffering from Anorexia Nervosa (AN) express clinical fear of gain weight and adopt extreme (life-threatening) avoidance behaviors that aim to maintain or reduce body weight. Differently from healthy individuals, in AN hunger seems to be perceived as a threat rather than a motivational drive for food intake. Hence, the anorexic subject avoids food and increases avoidance behaviors (e.g. exercising) to prevent /control the consequences of hunger (i.e. weight gain). Unlike excessive avoidance that characterizes other anxiety-related psychopathologies, excessive avoidance in AN has been often conceptualized as a personality trait  (harm avoidance). Yet, a deeper mechanistic understanding of avoidance behaviors in AN is missing in literature. In this project, we are employing an avoidance-relief task (ART) to investigate the presence of excessive avoidance (and the possible over-reinforcing effects of relief on its course) in individuals with a diagnosis of AN.
