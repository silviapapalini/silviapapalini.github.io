What is mindfullness eating? 
"It is deliberately paying attention, being fully aware of what is happening both inside and outside yourself in your body, heart and mind and outside yourself, in your environment.  Mindfulness is awareness without criticism or judgment" (cit. by Jan Chozen Bays and Char Wilkins).

I was introduced to Mindfulness Eating by Caroline Baerten, one of the most insiring persons I ever met in my live. She followed me during my course in Mindful Based Stress Reduction (MBRS) in Brussel, and, as simple it migth sound, I found myself fully connected to the ZEN-based phylosophy of this practice. I then felt that a formative mindful path that was closer to my research interest, passions, and values, was really needed. Hence, I flew to Norway where I had the immense pleasure to attend the Mindful Eating-Conscious Living training with Jan Chozen Bays and Char Wilkins (https://me-cl.com/our-story/), the gretest experience of my life. 

My wish for the future? To reach excellent research output that can be used to improve the outcome of this valuable practice.
