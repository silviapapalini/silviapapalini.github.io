## My academic path

{{< figure src="silvia.jpg" class="floatright" >}}

I hold a Master's degree in Experimental Psychology and obtained my first Ph.D. in Psychological Sciences at the University of Florence (UniFi), Italy, conducting basic research on reward-related brain processes in humans. I developed my scientific knowledge on reward-processing and neuroimaging skills also working in collaboration with the Maastricht University (The Netherlands) via an Erasmus+ European grant. In 2016, I became a member of the 'Food and Cognition group' at the Donders Institute (The Netherlands) where I investigated the effects of a probiotic diet on neuro-cognition and stress, with a focus on cognitive control mechanisms. In 2018, I started a second Ph.D. at KULeuven with the aim of translating knowledge from fundamental research to the clinical field. Currently, I am a postdoc researcher at the BRAMlab and I am specialized in studying the emotion of relief at the subjective, behavioral, physiological, and brain levels.

## My research

The final aim of my research is to help people who struggle with excessive anxiety and emotional (non)eating. I am fascinated by the bidirectional relationship between food and learning. Currently, I am investigating the effects of overnight fasting and the role of dopamine-mediated mechanisms (i.e., relief) on conditioning, error-based learning, and instrumental avoidance. I am conducting research in healthy individuals as well as in individuals with pathological control and excessive avoidance behaviors (i.e., anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder). In my research, I like to apply an interdisciplinary approach, integrating behavioral research, nutritional science, and neuroimaging (3TfMRI). To transfer my scientific knowledge to the applied field I have participated in the Mindful Eating professional training (ME-CL1) and became a Mindful Eating teacher in training.

## My future aspirations as a researcher

Currently, I am an MSCA aspirant/applicant. If founded, my project will focus on the fundamental learning processes underpinning excessive emotional eating.
