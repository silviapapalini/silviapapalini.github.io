I am a PhD candidate in Psychology at KULeuven University (Belgium). I hold a Master's degree in Experimental Psychology and obtained my first PhD in Psychological Sciences at the University of Florence (UniFi), Italy, conducting basic research on reward-related brain processes in humans. I developed my scientific knowledge on reward-processing and neuroimaging skills also working in collaboration with the Maastricht University (The Netherlands) via an Erasmus+ European grant. In 2016, I became a member of the 'Food and Cognition group' at the Donders Institute (The Netherlands) where I investigated the effects of probiotics on neuro-cognition, with a focus on cognitive control mechanisms. Since 2018, I started a second PhD at KU Leuven with the aim to translate knowledge from fundamental research to the clinical field. 

The final aim of my research is to help people that struggele with excessive anxiety and emotional (non)eating. I am fascinated by the bidirectional relationship between food and learning. Currently, I am investigating the effects of overnight fasting and the role of dopamine-mediated mechanisms (i.e., relief) on  conditioning, error-based learning and instrumental avoidance. I am conducting research in healthy individuals as well as in individuals with pathological control and excessive avoidance behaviors (i.e., anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder). In my research, I like to apply an interdisciplinary approach, integrating behavioral research, nutritional science, and neuroimaging (fMRI). To transfer my scientific knowledge to the applied field I have participated in the Mindful Eating professional training (ME-CL1) and became a Mindful Eating teacher in training. 

Currently I am an European Research Council (ERC) starting grant aspirant/applicat. My ERC project will focus on the fondamental learning processes underpinning excessive emotional eating.
